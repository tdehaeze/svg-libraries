#+TITLE: SVG Library

This is my personal gathering of nice SVG libraries for scientific and technical schematics.
Please don't hesitate to add/modify some elements and send a pull request.

The idea is to have a set of components in order to easily make beautiful diagram for publication.

* Control and Systems
Various blocks.

* Optics
The optics library is taken from: http://www.gwoptics.org/ComponentLibrary/

* Mechanics

- Actuators (piezoelectric, electromagnetic, stepper, ...)
- Sensors (displacement, force, inertial, ...)
- Mechanical systems (mass spring damper, beam, plates, ...)

* Electrical Circuits
The electrical library is taken from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electrical_symbols_library.svg
